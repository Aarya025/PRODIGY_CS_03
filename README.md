Password complexity checker

1. Complexity Evaluation
Character Diversity: The application assesses the variety of characters used in passwords, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
Length Requirement: It enforces a minimum password length to increase security.
Common Patterns: The checker identifies and warns against common patterns and easily guessable passwords.
2. User Feedback
Strength Rating: Users receive immediate feedback on the strength of their passwords, categorized as weak, moderate, or strong.
Improvement Suggestions: The application provides actionable suggestions for enhancing password security.
3. Python Libraries
This project deepened my knowledge of Python's standard libraries and regular expressions (regex), which are utilized for pattern matching and string analysis.
4. Problem-Solving
Algorithm Development: I developed algorithms to systematically analyze password characteristics and determine complexity levels.
Handling Edge Cases: The application accounts for various edge cases, such as empty strings or excessively long passwords, ensuring robust functionality.
5. Practical Application
This project highlights the importance of password security in protecting personal and sensitive information, applicable in fields like cybersecurity, data protection, and online account management.
