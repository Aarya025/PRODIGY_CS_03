# Password Complexity Checker ðŸ”‘

## Overview
The Password Complexity Checker is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords based on defined complexity rules. This project helps users create strong passwords by assessing their passwords against common security criteria.

## Features
- **Strength Assessment**: Evaluates password strength based on length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Customizable Rules**: Users can define their own complexity requirements.
- **Feedback on Passwords**: Provides real-time feedback on password strength and suggestions for improvement.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for this implementation.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Password-Complexity-Checker.git
   cd Password-Complexity-Checker
Run the Program: You can run the program directly using Python:

python password_checker.py
Usage
Input Password: Enter the password you want to check.
Get Feedback: The program will analyze the password and provide feedback on its strength.
Suggestions for Improvement: If the password does not meet complexity requirements, the program will suggest ways to strengthen it.
